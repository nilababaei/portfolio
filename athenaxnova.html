     concepts="The theme of the AthenaXNova website redesign was brought upon through the investigation of many concepts. Throughout the process, the following three themes were developed: minimal, grounding, and geometric. Through extensive research, it was concluded that the most effective way to attract the proper audience was to follow a more minimalist and modern theme."
     audience="Each week, we focused on designing different components of the website then continued by taking all of those common components and using them to build out a home page and a product list page. Near the end of the term, we handed of the pattern library to one of our classmates, who created the product details page and the checkout form page.

I decided to design my eCommerce website around my first concept being the AthenaXNova brand."

     branding="I began to create the brand around AthenaXNova. I developed the colour palette, typography, and logo. The visual design came into play when I began to pick the type scale, and designed some sample components that would be featured on the website. I also began to consider accessibility and performance for the website itself."

     prototype="The wireframes were the next step. I created wireframes for the homepage, product list page, product details page, and the checkout form page. They were high-fidelity and created in Adobe XD."

     development1="The development process began by the introduction of a pattern library. The pattern library is a collection of all the website components organized into sections. From the set-up of Jekyll—a static website generator—we were able to create short codes which would eventually be used to generate the website page. By using this website generator, it allowed for a more efficient development process and helped reduce any risks of duplicated code."
     development2="We covered a broad range of skills throughout the development of the pattern library. Some skills I developed include being able to develop my written, spoken, and visual abilities in a collaborative setting."
     development3="Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome of my e-commerce website. I was able to design and develop the AthenaXNova brand using the process of pattern libraries."
     development4="This project taught me how a complex process can be seamlessly combined into one system that can aid in simplifying a topic as complex as coding. The pattern library is a system that I will continue to use and it has enhanced my knowledge and skillset."
