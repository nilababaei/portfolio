    section_text="The focus of this project is on the design of an eCommerce website using a pattern library. Each week, we focused on designing different components of the website then continued by taking all of those common components and using them to build out a home page and a product list page. Near the end of the term, we handed of the pattern library to one of our classmates, who created the product details page and the checkout form page. The first step we took before beginning any design work was to choose the fictional brand we would move forth with. I decided to design my eCommerce website around my first concept being the AthenaXNova brand."
