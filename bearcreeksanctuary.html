      section_text1="The Bear Creek Sanctuary is a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center that provides safety and care to a large variety of wildlife ranging from bears to foxes."
      section_text2="My animal rescue website was developed at the end of 2018 as the summative in my web development course. When looking at the design and layout of the current and redesigned website, it needed an upgrade as the brand that it was advocating did not match the Bear Creek Sanctuaries voice. With the skills that I have managed to develop in the past years with both UI/UX and HTML5 and CSS, I knew that I could create a more effective website that could reach out to a broader audience."
      section_text3="The deliverable for this project is a fully redesigned website with basic HTML and CSS to showcase both my experience in UI/UX and web development. The handoff includes the wireframe mockups and the website development files."
