        section_text1="The Bear Creek Sanctuary is a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center that provides safety and care to a large variety of wildlife ranging from bears to foxes."
        section_text2="My animal rescue website was developed at the end of 2018 as the summative in my web development course. When looking at the design and layout of the current and redesigned website, it needed an upgrade as the brand that it was advocating did not match the Bear Creek Sanctuaries' voice. With the skills that I have managed to develop in the past few years in both UI/UX and HTML and CSS, I knew that I could create a more effective website that could reach out to a broader audience."
        section_text3="The deliverable for this project was a fully redesigned website with basic HTML and CSS to showcase both my experience in UI/UX and web development. The handoff included the wireframe mockups and the website development files."

     purpose="The goal of this redo project is to strengthen the branding for the Bear Creek Sanctuary while developing a fully responsive and accessible website for all users."
     goal="The main purpose of this website is to highlight the sponsorship program to attract more funding and support so that the Bear Creek Sanctuary can continue to protect and care for its wildlife."
     audience="The primary target audience for the Bear Creek Sanctuary website is any potential funders and sponsors who can aid the center financially."
     concepts="The theme of the Bear Creek Sanctuary website redesign was brought upon through the research of many concepts. Throughout the process, the following three themes were developed: earth, clean, and monochromatic. Through extensive research, it was concluded that the most effective way to attract the proper audience was to follow a more natural theme."
     sitemap-text="As the current website's sitemap is both confusing to navigate across and hard to follow, I wanted to move forward with a few pages so that the user can have an easy and simple experience."
     sitemap="sitemap/sitemap-bearcreeksanctuary.jpg"
     branding="As I continued to develop a stronger brand, I wanted to work alongside visuals as a supportive component of the website. Before beginning the wireframes, I created a folder with dozens of images that could potentially be used for the final product."
     moodboard="moodboards/moodboard-bearcreeksanctuary.jpg"
     prototype="The wireframes became a challenging aspect as I continued to move through the project. The first set of wireframes showcased shows the current website that the Bear Creek Sanctuary has. The second set was the redesign I put together during my first attempt at the redesign. The final is the current and final layout that I developed."

     development1="I decided to develop this website using only HTML and CSS. The process began by developing the main components, including the header and footer. From then on, I began adding sections while testing the responsivity and accessibility of the website."
     development2="The imagery was chosen to match alongside the brand as every photograph shows a strong natural theme paired alongside with an animal that is kept at the sanctuary."
     development3="This new website redesign is stronger in the sense of its design and development. It portrays the Bear Creek Sanctuary successfully through the choice of colour, imagery, and the simple logo redesign. It has a strong focus on the website's main purpose—to gain financial support through the sponsorship program."
     development4="With an updated modern and minimal design, the brand now matches the sanctuary as a whole. With the use of natural tones and a calming colour scheme, the entirety of the website exudes the feeling that the sanctuary represents such as feeling grounded, calm, protected, and wholesome."
