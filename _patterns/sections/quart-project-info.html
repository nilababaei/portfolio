      <p class="text-color text-left push-0">Once the research was completed, I started out by creating an in-depth sitemap of an already existing website in order to understand what components already exist. I considered the different elements they had including cards, banner types, form inputs.</p>

      <p class="text-color text-left push-0">I began to create the brand around AthenaXNova. I developed the colour palette, typography, and logo. The visual design came into play when I began to pick the type scale, and designed some sample components that would be featured on the website. I also began to consider accessibility and performance for the website itself.</p>

      <p class="text-color text-left push-0">The development process began by the introduction of a pattern library. The pattern library is a collection of all the website components organized into sections. From the set-up of Jekyll—a static website generator—we were able to create short codes which would eventually be used to generate the website page. By using this website generator, it allowed for a more efficient development process and helped reduce any risks of duplicated code.</p>

      <p class="text-color text-left push-1-2 bold">I was able to develop my skills by:</p>
      <ul class="list-group text-left text-color">
        <li>•	setting up repositories and branching through GitHub</li>
        <li>•	setting up hosting through Netlify</li>
        <li>•	writing in Markdown and YAML files</li>
        <li>•	proper documentation</li>
        <li>•	preparing product data</li>
        <li>•	build pages with patterns</li>
        <li>•	handing off work to teammates</li>
        <li>•	merging collaborative development work</li>
        <li>•	performance, accessibility, and browser testing</li>
        <li>•	using Terminal</li>
        <li>•	using the Ruby programming language</li>

      <h4 class="xmp push-0 text-left"><xmp><p></xmp></h4>
      <p class="text-color text-left">We covered a broad range of skills throughout the development of the pattern library. Some skills I developed include being able to develop my written, spoken, and visual abilities in a collaborative setting.</p>
      <p class="text-color text-left">Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome of my e-commerce website. I was able to design and develop the AthenaXNova brand using the process of pattern libraries.</p>
      <p class="text-color text-left push-0">This project taught me how a complex process can be seamlessly combined into one system that can aid in simplifying a topic as complex as coding. The pattern library is a system that I will continue to use and it has enhanced my knowledge and skillset.</p>
